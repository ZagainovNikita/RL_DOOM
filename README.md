This repo uses OpenAI gym models for playing three different game modes of DOOM. To test out, run:

python -m main.py

Then, enter the desired game mode (basic, defend_the_center, deadly_corridor). In case you chose deadly_corridor, choose difficulty level (d1-5)
The code for model training can be found in notebooks.
